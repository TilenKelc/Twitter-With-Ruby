This website is part of a school project, to code the backend of twitter functions. It is not a fake Twitter.

On the site, you can:
- make an account, login to existing account, 
- or you can login with facebook or google,
- make posts (they can contain either text or picture or both), 
- comment/reply to posts,
- like different posts,
- follow people and let other people follow you,
- see the people who are following you, who you are following and the posts you liked,
- you can edit your profile and upload your profile picture,
- the administrator can also delete posts,
- you can also use #something in posts to mark them and when you click the link you will be redirected to the page with tweets only having the #something in the text.

For this project to work all you need to do is download the files, upload the database to a server and that is it. The api's used are being either already hosted with the files or are being accessed directly by url's. The database is MySql 5.0 and is used with phpmyadmin.

Localhost
If used for localhost you will need to place the files in XAMPP, folder on your computer,  and use it with Apache and MySql turned on.
