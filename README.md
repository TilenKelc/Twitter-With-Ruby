This website is part of a school project, to code the backend of twitter functions. It is not a fake Twitter.

On the site, you can:
- make an account, login to existing account, 
- or you can login with facebook or google,
- make posts (they can contain either text or picture or both), 
- comment/reply to posts,
- like different posts,
- follow people and let other people follow you,
- see the people who are following you, who you are following and the posts you liked,
- you can edit your profile and upload your profile picture,
- the administrator can also delete posts,
- you can also use #something in posts to mark them and when you click the link you will be redirected to the page with tweets only having the #something in the text.

All the gems are present inside the GemFile, and all you need to do is run bundle install.
